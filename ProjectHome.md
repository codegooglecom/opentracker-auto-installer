This is a bash script that will allow anyone to install OpenTracker (BitTorrent) on their linux machine.
Easy and automated script allowing user to choose settings before installation

Tested and works on:
CentOS 5 (32bit and 64bit)
CentOS 6 (32bit and 64bit)
Debian 5 (32bit and 64bit)
Debian 6 (32bit and 64bit)
Ubuntu 10.10 (32bit and 64bit)
Ubuntu 11.04 (32bit and 64bit)

Should work on other distros but was not tested

Enjoy!
